## A new java game engine

Recently I stared work on a new java game engine. This is something I’ve wanted to do for a while but never managed to get the spare time with work taking priority. But now I should be able to spare some hours to work on my new game engine as a fun side project from my University work.

### So what’s the game engine like?

It’ll be a 2D engine and I have a game in mind that I’d like to develop for it. An [RTS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) game so for now the engine will be built with that in mind.  2D and RTS don’t really go well in modern day but I plan to mimic the older RTS games such as the [Command and Conquer]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer) franchise to construct my game engine.
